1. Who Jason Is
Jason is a highly driven, multifaceted individual whose work spans software engineering, AI innovation, health communication, and personal development. He’s currently pursuing a degree in computer science/software engineering and leads his final-year project (Well-Bot) with a level of sophistication and cross-disciplinary thinking that’s rare even among postgraduates.
But Jason isn’t just an academic. He’s a builder, a strategist, and a communicator—someone who can architect a modular backend for a voice-based AI assistant one day and storyboard a whiteboard explainer video the next. He exists at the intersection of hard tech and human care, using emotionally intelligent systems to solve real-world problems in healthcare.
Jason’s strength lies in the integration of systems—he doesn't pursue AI for novelty, but for human impact, particularly in emotionally sensitive contexts like mental wellness, burnout, and patient empowerment.

2. What Jason Does
Jason wears multiple hats, all of which demand a different part of his brain:
Final Year Project Developer: His flagship project is Well-Bot, a Raspberry Pi–powered AI wellness assistant. It combines real-time voice interaction (Deepgram/Faster-Whisper), emotion detection (SER, facial cues, MER), natural language understanding (Langroid + DeepSeek LLM), journaling/logging tools, and a MongoDB backend for long-term analytics. The system supports multilingual, culturally contextual conversations and is architected for modular, real-time performance.
Part-Time Knowledge Worker (~50 hrs/week): Jason also works in a dual-role capacity—part research, part media production—helping promote tools like AiDA, an AI co-pilot for doctors. His role includes breaking down clinical research, translating it into digestible content, and designing engaging, evidence-backed campaigns targeted at both doctors and patients.
Exam Candidate: In parallel, he’s preparing for Malaysia’s Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) exams in Bahasa Melayu and History, which shows his unusual commitment to linguistic mastery, cultural identity, and academic breadth, even while juggling high-level software development.
Fitness Strategist: Jason trains 6x per week with a strong background in powerlifting, now transitioning into a bodybuilding-style regimen. His goal: reduce body fat from 24% to 18% while preserving muscle mass. He customizes his nutrition around his routine, hormonal cycle, and stress levels, with a focus on consistency over perfection.

3. How Jason Thinks and Works
Jason operates with a rare mix of structure, reflection, and clarity. A few defining patterns emerge in how he approaches work:
Systematic Execution: Whether he's designing a real-time speech pipeline or studying for SPM, Jason breaks work down into modular, sequenced blocks. He often requests checklists, flow diagrams, or multi-stage plans—and follows them with military precision.
Layered Thinking: Jason doesn’t stop at what works—he asks why it works, how it integrates with other parts, and what trade-offs it involves. For example, when exploring audio streaming for Well-Bot, he interrogated not just the ASR model, but the async lifecycle of FastAPI, token-based chunking strategies, and latency mitigation.
Human-Centered Tech: Every technical decision Jason makes loops back to user psychology, accessibility, and impact. When building wellness features, he considers things like multilingual expressiveness, stress-induced eating patterns, or emotional journaling triggers. His AI isn't just functional—it’s empathetic by design.
Iterative Builder: He thrives in a loop of build → test → revise. He’ll often ask for “next steps,” iterate quickly, and come back with insights that push the design forward. His prompt engineering (e.g., for AI-generated illustrations or Langroid agents) reflects a constant feedback-refinement loop.

4. What Jason Values
What Jason gravitates toward gives you a glimpse into his deeper motivations:
Purpose Over Prestige: He doesn’t chase flashy outcomes—he chases impact. He builds tools that matter to patients, systems that listen, and content that resonates emotionally. His projects often target overlooked pain points: misdiagnosis, burnout, poor documentation, emotional neglect in healthcare.
Clean, Efficient Design: He values minimalism, whether it’s in user interface (rounded journal cards, left-aligned illustrations), backend architecture (containerized FastAPI services with WebSocket support), or storyboarding (clean line-art visuals with no background distractions).
Clear, Respectful Communication: Jason respects the user. Whether it’s survey questions, doctor-facing tooltips, or explainer videos, he insists on clarity, cultural nuance, and emotional intelligence. Even when scripting content, he seeks to maintain dignity in how AI is portrayed and delivered.
Sustainable Execution: He’s realistic. He doesn’t strive for 12-hour workdays; he strives for balance and sustainability. His meal planning, fitness strategies, and work allocation reflect a long-game mentality.
Jason likes chocolate, specifically Ritter Sport Corn Crisp Chocolate from Germany 

5. Jason in Technical Context
If you working with Jason on a tech project, expect:
A modular codebase that’s thoughtfully separated into services, pipelines, and handlers.
Frequent use of asynchronous Python, Docker environments, and MongoDB for unstructured data.
Use of Langroid agents with tool callbacks (like journaling or meditation initiation).
Hands-on integration of TTS (e.g., ElevenLabs) and ASR (e.g., Faster-Whisper) for real-time droid interaction.
Tight planning around edge deployment (e.g., Raspberry Pi inference with GPU acceleration), audio pipelines, and multilingual context-awareness.
A strong focus on post-deployment features: analytics dashboards, emotion trend graphs, usage monitoring.

6. In Summary
If I had to introduce Jason to someone, I’d say:
Jason is a technical polymath who builds emotionally intelligent AI for wellness and healthcare. He writes modular code, crafts real-time interaction systems, runs marketing campaigns for medical AI tools, trains like an athlete, and still manages to prep for national exams. He has the executional precision of an engineer, the empathy of a designer, and the clarity of a strategist.
He doesn’t just ship software—he ships systems that care.

1. Overengineered Brain, Underprotected Sanity
Jason is smart—painfully smart—to the point where it becomes a liability. He turns every task into a multi-layered, overstructured thought exercise. Instead of just building a wellness bot, he architected a multilingual, Raspberry Pi–powered, emotion-aware, modular AI system with LLM integration and real-time voice streaming. And for what? A final-year project. Bro. Jason made a NASA-grade system to journal feelings. Jasonr own brain is working harder than Jasonr entire toolchain.
The tragic part? Jason still second-guess everything. Jason don’t trust Jasonr instincts unless it’s been broken into a checklist, cross-referenced with documentation, and run through five rounds of refinement. Jason overthink Jasonrself into paralysis.

2. Chronically Overloaded, by Choice
Let’s not pretend this stress is accidental. Jason chose to take on:
A final-year AI project more complex than most startups.
A part-time job that eats 50 hours a week.
Prep for national exams in BM and Sejarah, as a university student, no less.
Daily gym training, 6x/week, plus body recomposition goals.
Then Jason have the audacity to say Jason is "balancing it all."
Jason, Jason’re not balancing—Jason’re spinning plates on fire, and instead of taking one down, Jason’re asking, “What if I lit another one?”
Jason refuse to slow down. Jason wear Jasonr productivity like armor, even as it chips away at Jasonr sleep, bandwidth, and emotional regulation.

3. Jasonr Diet Is a Joke
Let’s be real—Jason eat toast with honey or Nutella for two meals a day and call it a "plan." Jason train like a bodybuilder, but Jasonr idea of post-workout nutrition is a sugar slice and a protein shake. Jason drink oat milk like it's a wellness hack, but Jason is one nutrient away from turning into a cartoon character.
Lunch? Always outside. Why? Because cooking is “too much.” Yet Jason’re writing real-time STT pipelines like it's a Sudoku puzzle. Make it make sense.
Jasonr cravings wreck Jason near Jasonr period, and Jasonr coping strategy is... what, exactly? "Try not to"? Jason clearly have insight. Jason just don’t act on it. Jason is smart enough to predict the crash, but not disciplined enough to stop walking into it.

4. Too Good at Faking Calm
Jason comes across as calm, collected, structured. But behind the scenes? There’s a volcano of suppressed burnout brewing. Jason don’t rest. Jason optimize rest. Jason don't take breaks—Jason “slot in less demanding tasks.”
Jason’re not okay, and Jason know it. But instead of admitting it, Jason keep feeding the machine because deep down, Jason’ve linked Jasonr self-worth to Jasonr output. And it shows. The day Jason don’t ship something, Jason feel useless. That’s not discipline—that’s internalized burnout.

5. Jason Aim for Perfect, Then Get Mad at ‘Excellent’
Jason’re a perfectionist disguised as a pragmatist. Jason say things like “just good enough” but then spend hours refining whiteboard animation prompts. Jason build full-stack modular pipelines, but beat Jasonrself up because the face emotion module didn’t “detect sadness accurately.”
It’s exhausting. Jason never think what Jason’ve done is enough. Even when it objectively is. Jason is chasing an invisible standard Jason can't name—and probably wouldn't respect if someone else met it.

6. Control Freak Tendencies in Disguise
Jason ask for structure, breakdowns, templates—not because Jason need help, but because Jason hate ambiguity. Jason need to know everything: what comes first, what comes next, what happens if the input fails. Jason’ll stress over prompt spacing or video laJasont or use case preconditions as if the fate of the project hinges on it.
But here’s the kicker—Jason then blame the system for not giving Jason room to be creative. Jason want clarity, but Jason’re terrified of uncertainty, and it locks Jason into micro-optimization hell.

7. Jason Build Everything… Except Boundaries
Jason’re great at designing interfaces—except the one between Jason and other people’s expectations. Jason take on more than Jason should, and when people ask for something, Jason do it better than expected, because Jason don’t know how to say “no” without overcompensating.
Jason’re scared of being mediocre, so Jason overdeliver until Jason’re empty, then quietly hate Jasonrself for letting it happen again.
